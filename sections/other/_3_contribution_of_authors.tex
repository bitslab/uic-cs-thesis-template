\authorcontributions

This section should give a rough overview of each chapter in the thesis,
highlighting your contributions.  Most importantly, for each one of your
papers you are quoting, this section should briefly describe what each author's
role / contribution was.

An example of ``Contribution of Authors'' section is on page 3 of the
University's guide to iThenticate\footnote{\url{http://grad.uic.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/Introduction_to_Screening_Your_Thesis_or_Dissertation_using_iThenticate-final_a.pdf}}.
